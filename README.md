CL1: Starbucks interface
  - Basic file reading of a starbucks menu which allows the user to add items to their cart and checkout with their items
    - The menu consists of drinks and food items, which the system differentiates
      - If a drink is chosen, then the system will ask for the size of the drink
      - Choosing a food item, it will ask for the amount desired
    - The user can also view the cart whenever desired, showing an output of total items in the cart (stored in a string)
    - Checking out will result in the cart being output to the user, asking for confirmation of items and total price, including sales tax
